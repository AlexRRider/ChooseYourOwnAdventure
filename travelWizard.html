        <p>You inform Tim-the-All-Powerful-and-Extreamly-Awesome-Wizard of your quest and he offers to teleport you straight to the island of the Very-Old-Tribe. You drive your increadibly awesome 2004 Buick Centry&trade; to Tim-the-All-Powerful-and-Extreamly-Awesome-Wizard's house and he invites you inside. After a delicious meal of chicky nuggies and choccy milk you head to the 11 1/2 floor of his wizard tower where he asks you if you've washed your hands.<br><br>Tim-the-All-Powerful-and-Extreamly-Awesome-Wizard: Have you washed your hands?<br><br>You lie and say you did.<br><br>He begins the teleportation ritual, but halfway through the left over chicken grease on your left index finger begins to glow. Instead of teleporting to the island of the Very-Old-Tribe, you are turned into a chicken.<br><br>You live the remainder of your pultry existance as Tim-the-All-Powerful-and-Extreamly-Awesome-Wizard's pet.</P>
