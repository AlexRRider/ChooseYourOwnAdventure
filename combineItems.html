        <p>You tie the gem to the dinosaur tooth, and declare it a Really-Cool-Artifact. Gathering your bearings, you continue on your way to the temple. Eventually you find and enter the temple. There you are greated by a witchdoctor with dope makeup and tatoos and a really cool skull on his belt.<br><br>Dope Witchdoctor: What do you want, strange adventurer?<br><br>You tell him you are after the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors.<br><br>Dope Witchdoctor: The prophecy states only the one who has a Really-Cool-Artifact can take the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors. Do you have a Really-Cool-Artifact?<br><br>You pull out the Really-Cool-Artifact that you created and show it to him.<br><br>He bows before you then rises and leads you to the treasure chamber. Inside is heaps and heaps of gold (the thing that you've secretly been hoping would be here the whole time) and on a pedistal in the center of the room is the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors.<br><br>Dope Witchdoctor: Would you stay here? We would make you king and follow you.<br><br>Do you take the gem and return home? Or do you stay and rule as their king?</P>
