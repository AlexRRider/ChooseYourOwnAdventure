        <p>You decline his offer and simply take the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors and enough gold to continue your retirement for the next 10 years until you get bored again. You return through the jungle and climb aboard the plane, giving Frank a gold piece for his trouble. You fly home and shedule a meeting with the authors of the letter.<br><br>Two weeks later you're at a local coffee shop and handing over the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors.<br><br>Letter Author 1: Good work Ohio James, this will do quite nicely.<br><br>Letter Author 2: Quick question, can we get an autograph?<br><br>You sigh, but agree and sign his notebook. You head home to continue your retirement in peace... until one day you see a letter...<br><br><span style="display: block; text-align: center;">!!! You won! Congratulations! !!!</span></P>
