        <p>You set to work. Bound and determined you use your super strong adventurer hands to dig up the gem. After you dig it up, you can say for sure it's not the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors, but it is a neat gem. You're tired so you take a seat on a headstone and pull out your Jack Link's Original Beef Jerky&trade; and munch on that for a while.<br><br>As you go to put it away, you hear a loud thund in the distance. And then another. And another. It's getting closer. You've watched the all time classic, Jurassic Park&trade; | Directed and Produced by Steven Spielberg | Starring big names such as Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Richard Attenborough, enough times to know that that's a dinosaur.<br><br>Do you hide? Do you run? Or do you fight?</P>
