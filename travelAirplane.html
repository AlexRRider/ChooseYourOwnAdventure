        <p>You inform Frank the piolt of your quest. Frank agrees to take you to the island of the Very-Old-Tribe and in just three short days you're off and in the air. You land 10 hours later on a small landingstrip on an island you've never seen before. Frank agrees to wait at the plane for 3 days. If you take longer than that, he'll assume you're dead.<br><br>Do you venture into the village to ask the locals for directions? Or head off by yourself?</P>
