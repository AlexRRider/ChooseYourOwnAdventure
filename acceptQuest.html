    <h1>Accept the Quest</h1>
    <main>    
        <p>This is just what you were hoping for! A chance to see the world again and do some cool things. You pack your supplies, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clothes</li>
            <li>Gun</li>
            <li>The Quencher ProTour Flip Straw Tumbler | 40 oz | Cream Moon Color | Stanly Cup&trade;</li>
            <li>Jack Link's Original Beef Jerky&trade;</li>
        </ul>
        <P>You debate taking your really cool artifact, but you'll get a new one on this adventure, so you leave it at home.<br><br>Checking the map you realize it'll take some traveling to get to the island the Very-Old-Tribe is on. Thinking back to your adventuring days you think you could reach out to a few old contacts; Harv the boat guy, Tim-the-All-Powerful-and-Extreamly-Awesome-Wizard, or Frank the piolt.<br><br>Do you travel by boat? Travel by wizard? Or travel by airplane?</P>
