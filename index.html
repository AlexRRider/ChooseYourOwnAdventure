        <p>Welcome to my school project: The Hunt for Lost Gold! This is a choose your own adventure style game. There is only one correct ending, but many paths to choose. Follow the links along the path you think is best to make your way to the end. If you want, you can keep track of the number of attempts it takes you, and sumbit your final amount in the form in the appropriate section.</p>
        <h2>To Begin the Adventure Click Start</h2><a tag="start link" href="start.html" style="font-size: x-large;">START</a>
        <h2>Number of Tries Form</h2>
        <p>Fill out the form with your three letter (or number) username and the number of tries it took you to reach the ending.</p>
