    <h1>Travel by boat.</h1>
    <main>    
        <p>You inform Harv of your quest and in less than a week you're off! Heading down the coast you make it 20 miles before rounding the first island and changing course for the open ocean. You and Harv are busy on day 2 with an intense game of two-person singleplayer solitare: pirate edition, and fail to notice that the Kraken has grabbed onto your ship and torn a hole in the haul. You slowly drown waiting for Harv to decide if he should place his pirate-king-of-hearts on the pirate-queen-of-spades or the pirate-queen-of-clubs.</P>
