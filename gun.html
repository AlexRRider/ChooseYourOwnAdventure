    <h1>Gun</h1>
    <main>    
        <p>You pull out your gun and plant your feet firmly in the ground. Visualizing success, you steady yourself and wait for the dino to emerge. Moments later, the T-Rex burst from the trees. You unload six (6) shots from your revolver straight through it's eye, hitting it's brain and killing it instantly. As it falls to the ground, one of it's teeth comes loose.<br><br>Do you bother taking the tooth or continue on to the temple?</P>
