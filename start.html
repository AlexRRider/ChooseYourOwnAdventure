        <p>You are the brave adventurer Ohio James! Or at least, you used to be. It's been 10 years into your retirement and you're begining to miss the danger and excitment of treasure hunting.</p>
        <p>Sipping your morning coffee you go to check the mail and see a mysterious envelope addressed to you, but written in unfamilier handwriting. Opening the letter two pieces of paper emerge. One, a map, the other, a note. The note reads:
        <blockquote>
            Dear Ohio James,<br><br>We are quite familiar with your work involving the Not-So-Holy-Grail, the Plastic-Ark-of-the-Promise, and the Temple-of-Nothing-Dangerous, and are offering you a chance to prove yourself again. Follow the enclosed map to the anceint treasure of the Very-Old-Tribe and bring us the Gem-of-Really-Cool-Colors.<br><br>P.S. We are really big fans and would like an autograph too.<br><br>P.P.S. You can keep the gold.
        </blockquote>
